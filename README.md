*üìå Project Title*: Decision Tree Implementation for Classification Tasks
As part of my data science internship, I worked on a practical machine learning task focused on implementing and evaluating a Decision Tree Classifier using Python. This project gave me hands-on experience with one of the most interpretable and widely used classification algorithms in supervised learning.

The goal of this task was to understand the end-to-end process of building a Decision Tree model‚Äîfrom data preprocessing to training, evaluation, and visualization.

*üîç Project Overview*:
The task began with importing essential Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. I worked on a sample dataset that included both categorical and numerical features. The dataset was loaded and explored to understand its structure and quality. Using df.head(), df.info(), and df.describe(), I examined the first few records, data types, and statistical properties of the dataset.

*üßπ Data Preprocessing*:
Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables was a crucial part of preprocessing. I used techniques such as:

Label Encoding for categorical features to convert string labels into numeric format suitable for model training.

Checked for missing values using isnull().sum() and took necessary actions to ensure data quality.

These steps were essential for preparing the dataset for use in scikit-learn models, which require numerical inputs and complete data.

*üå≥ Model Training and Evaluation*:
Next, I implemented a Decision Tree Classifier from the sklearn.tree module. The steps included:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split().

Training the model using the .fit() method on the training data.

Making predictions using the .predict() method on the test data.

For evaluation, I calculated several key performance metrics:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

These metrics helped assess how well the model generalized to unseen data.

*üìä Visualization*:
To make the model more interpretable, I visualized the trained Decision Tree using plot_tree() from sklearn. This visualization displayed the feature splits, thresholds, and class predictions, giving a clear picture of how the tree makes decisions.

I also used a heatmap of the confusion matrix to better visualize the classification performance.

*üß† Learning Outcomes*:
This task helped me understand not just the theory behind Decision Trees, but also how to implement them practically. I gained knowledge about:

Data encoding and preprocessing

Model fitting and evaluation

Visualizing and interpreting decision logic

Advantages and limitations of tree-based models

*‚úÖ Conclusion*:
Implementing a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch using Python was an insightful experience that enhanced my machine learning skills. It taught me how to deal with real-world data and extract meaningful results using statistical and algorithmic techniques. This task also laid the foundation for exploring more advanced ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting in the future.
